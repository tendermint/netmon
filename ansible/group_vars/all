## service variable defines which service is going to be managed. It can be set to basecoind or ethermint.
service: basecoind

## release_install indicates if the install role should look for a privately built binary after installing the service package. If set to false, the privately built binary in the GOPATH is going to override the binary on the target systems.
#release_install: true

## binary stores the path to the privately built service binary, if there is any. By default it uses the GOPATH environment variable.
#binary: "{{ lookup('env','GOPATH') | default('') }}/bin/{{service}}"

##
## config

## tendermint_genesis_file contains the path and filename to a previously generated genesis.json for the underlying tendermint service. If undefined, the json file is dynamically generated.
#tendermint_genesis_file: "<undefined>"

## service_genesis_file contains the path and filename to a previously generated genesis.json for the service. If undefined, the json file is dynamically generated.
#service_genesis_file: "<undefined>"

## testnet_name is used to find seed IPs and public keys and set the chain_id in genesis.json and config.toml
#testnet_name: testnet1

## app_options_file contains a path and filename which will be included in a generated service genesis.json file on all nodes. The content will be dumped into the app_options dictionary in the service genesis.json..
#app_options_file: "app_options_files/dev_money"

## Internal use only. validators indicates if the nodes are validator nodes. The tendermint genesis.json will contain their public keys.
#validators: true

## Internal use only. seeds contain the list of servers (with ports) that are validators in a testnet. Only effective if validators == false. If validators == true, then all nodes will be automatically included here.
